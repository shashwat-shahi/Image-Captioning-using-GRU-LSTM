# Image-Captioning-using-GRU-LSTM
This project implements an image captioning system using deep learning architecturesâ€”GRU (Gated Recurrent Units) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory). It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature extraction from images, and sequence modeling for generating natural language captions from image inputs.
